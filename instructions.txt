### How to install the gui in windows
Install the node.js LTS version from here: https://nodejs.org/en/. To verify installation, open the git bash command line tool (or your preferred command-line tool) and enter "node -v" followed by "npm -v".
After that install the gui as instructed.

### build the app (not required for starting the app after a code change)
Create a .npmrc file in the project root with this line: legacy-peer-deps=true
1. way (preffered and faster)
- npm install
- npm run only_build

2. way
- install the dependancies: npm install
- build the app: npm run build
- install again: npm install (because the "build" script from the package.json triggers "npm install --production" which modifies the node_modules dependencies)

In the custom-config.json override the api.sparql.uri property to be: "https://sparql.europeana.eu/", instead of "https://query.wikidata.org/sparql".

### Code location
The code is located in the /opt/sparql-ui/sparql-ui dir.

### Deploy a new code (new branch or similar)
- pull the latest changes: git pull origin <branch_name>
- start the app in a background mode: nohup ./startSparqlUi.sh > sparqlUiOutput.txt 2>&1 (the .sh file may need the exec permission, so add it with: chmod +x startSparqlUi.sh)
- clear cache for the app page to see the new changes (here some help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcCpHNp2SkA) 

For the docker, there is also a .dockerignore file, used to tell which files to ignore, like node_modules, that are created by executing commands in the Dockerfile, and therefore
does not need copying.
