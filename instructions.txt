### Switch the environment between the wikidata and europeana
Find the files with the name "*-Wikidata.*" and rename their partner files (files with the same name but without the "-Wikidata" part) to have 
the "-Europeana" part (similarly to the name of the files with the "-Wikidata" part) in its name. Then remove the "-Wikidata" part from the files
that have that. In case there are no files with the "-Wikidata" part in its name, then start with the files with the "-Europeana" part in its name
and do the oposite changing.
