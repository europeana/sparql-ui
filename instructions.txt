### How to install the gui in windows
Install the node.js LTS version from here: https://nodejs.org/en/. To verify installation, open the git bash command line tool (or your preferred command-line tool) and enter "node -v" followed by "npm -v".
After that install the gui as instructed.

### build the app
Create a .npmrc file in the project root with this line: legacy-peer-deps=true
- install the dependancies: npm install
- build the app: npm run build
- install again: npm install

### Switch the environment between the wikidata and europeana
Find the files with the name "*-Wikidata.*" and rename their partner files (files with the same name but without the "-Wikidata" part) to have 
the "-Europeana" part (similarly to the name of the files with the "-Wikidata" part) in its name. Then remove the "-Wikidata" part from the files
that have that. In case there are no files with the "-Wikidata" part in its name, then start with the files with the "-Europeana" part in its name
and do the oposite changing.

### Code location
The code is located in the /opt/sparql-ui/sparql-ui dir.

### Deploy a new code (new branch or similar)
- pull the latest changes: git pull origin <branch_name>
- start the app in a background mode: nohup ./startSparqlUi.sh > sparqlUiOutput.txt 2>&1 (the .sh file may need the exec permission, so add it with: chmod +x startSparqlUi.sh)
- clear cache for the app page to see the new changes (here some help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcCpHNp2SkA)
