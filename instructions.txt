### How to install the gui in windows
Install the node.js LTS version from here: https://nodejs.org/en/. To verify installation, open the git bash command line tool (or your preferred command-line tool) and enter "node -v" followed by "npm -v".
After that install the gui as instructed.

### build the app (not required for starting the app after a code change)
Create a .npmrc file in the project root with this line: legacy-peer-deps=true
1. way (preffered and faster)
- npm install
- npm run only_build

2. way
- install the dependancies: npm install
- build the app: npm run build
- install again: npm install (because the "build" script from the package.json triggers "npm install --production" which modifies the node_modules dependencies)

In the custom-config.json override the api.sparql.uri property to be: "https://sparql.europeana.eu/" (or "https://api.test.eanadev.org/sparql/"), instead of "https://query.wikidata.org/sparql".

### Code location
The code is located in the /opt/sparql-ui/sparql-ui dir.

### Deploy a new code (new branch or similar) to the AIT test server
- pull the latest changes: git pull origin <branch_name>
- start the app in a background mode: nohup ./startSparqlUi.sh > sparqlUiOutput.txt 2>&1 (the .sh file may need the exec permission, so add it with: chmod +x startSparqlUi.sh)
- clear cache for the app page to see the new changes (here some help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcCpHNp2SkA) 

### For the docker, there is also a .dockerignore file, used to tell which files to ignore. To create a docker image,
first run the 2 commands:
- npm ci
- npm run only_build
The 2 commands will create the build folder and the npde_modules folder which are needed in the docker image.
Then the Dockerfile can run to create the image.

### When modifying the source code please note that the code is written in a way to support both the "wikidata.org" and "europeana" sparql-ui, which is decided by the propery 
api.sparql.uri in the default-config.json which is overriden by the custom-config.json. So please note when you change the code, to have that in mind, and e.g. if some ui elements 
are to be changed for the "europeana", check first if the sparqlUri does not include "wikidata.org" (!sparqlUri.includes("wikidata.org")), as we did so far.
